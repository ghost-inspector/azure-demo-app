# Node.js sample for Azure App Service - Express

This is a Node.js web app built on the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework that you can deploy 
to Azure App Service. 

This code is the default app as generated by the 
[Express application generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator).

We have written a [blog post for deploying this sample app to Azure using VSTS and testing it
using Ghost Inspector](https://ghostinspector.com/blog/deploy-and-test-your-app-with-vsts-azure-ghost-inspector/).
